This refactoring aims to establish a clean, maintainable architecture with proper service lifecycle management, eliminating the 226+ Manager classes anti-pattern, and implementing proper dependency injection patterns.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis refactoring aligns with the system's goal to provide a stable, high-performance quantitative trading platform by addressing fundamental architectural technical debt that currently impacts:\r\n- System startup time (20-30 seconds)\r\n- Memory usage (excessive due to duplicate instances)\r\n- Development velocity (complex debugging, feature conflicts)\r\n- System reliability (initialization race conditions)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Service Lifecycle Management\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to initialize services exactly once in a controlled sequence, so that startup is predictable and resource usage is optimized.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the system starts THEN each service SHALL be initialized exactly once\r\n2. IF a service fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error reporting\r\n3. WHEN services are shut down THEN they SHALL be disposed of in reverse dependency order\r\n4. WHEN checking service health THEN the system SHALL report the status of all registered services\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Manager Class Consolidation\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified service architecture with clear responsibilities, so that I can easily understand and modify system components.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no more than 15 service classes total\r\n2. IF multiple managers handle similar concerns THEN they SHALL be consolidated into domain-specific services\r\n3. WHEN creating new functionality THEN it SHALL follow the established service patterns\r\n4. WHEN services interact THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces and dependency injection\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Plugin System Unification\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want a single, consistent plugin interface and lifecycle, so that plugin development is straightforward and predictable.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the system discovers plugins THEN it SHALL use a single plugin discovery mechanism\r\n2. IF multiple plugin managers exist THEN they SHALL be unified into one PluginService\r\n3. WHEN plugins are loaded THEN they SHALL follow a standardized lifecycle (discover → validate → initialize → activate)\r\n4. WHEN plugins fail THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation without affecting other plugins\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Data Flow Optimization\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As an end user, I want the system to respond quickly to my actions, so that my trading analysis workflow is efficient.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the system starts THEN initialization SHALL complete in under 15 seconds\r\n2. IF data sources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful feedback and fallback options\r\n3. WHEN multiple data sources provide the same data THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate processing\r\n4. WHEN data flows through the system THEN it SHALL follow a clear pipeline pattern with proper error handling\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5: Configuration Management\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized configuration management with validation, so that system behavior is predictable and errors are caught early.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the system starts THEN all configuration SHALL be validated before service initialization\r\n2. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL report specific validation errors\r\n3. WHEN configuration changes THEN affected services SHALL be notified and updated appropriately\r\n4. WHEN services need configuration THEN they SHALL receive it through dependency injection\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service class should handle one domain of concern\r\n- **Dependency Inversion**: Services should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations\r\n- **Service Locator Anti-pattern**: Eliminate direct service container access from business logic\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: All services should implement well-defined contracts\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- System startup time: Reduce from 20-30 seconds to under 15 seconds\r\n- Memory usage: Reduce by 200-300MB through elimination of duplicate instances\r\n- Plugin loading: Parallel loading where dependencies allow\r\n- Data processing: Implement proper caching and avoid redundant operations\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Service boundaries: Clear separation between trusted and untrusted code\r\n- Plugin sandboxing: Plugins should not have direct access to system internals\r\n- Configuration validation: Prevent injection attacks through configuration\r\n- Error information: Don't leak internal system details in error messages\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- Graceful degradation: System should function with reduced capability when services fail\r\n- Error recovery: Services should implement proper retry and circuit breaker patterns\r\n- State consistency: Service state should remain consistent during failures\r\n- Monitoring: All services should provide health check and metrics endpoints\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- Clear error messages: Users should understand what went wrong and how to fix it\r\n- Progress feedback: Long-running operations should provide progress indication\r\n- Rollback capability: Configuration and system changes should be reversible\r\n- Documentation: All public APIs and configuration options should be documented\r\n",
